# Pygame Shooting Gallery

This project is a simple shooting gallery game built using Pygame, a popular library for creating games in Python. 

The game features a crosshair controlled by the mouse to shoot at various targets displayed on the screen. 

Different target sprites have different behaviors upon collision with the crosshair.

# Features

Crosshair Sprite: The game uses a custom crosshair sprite that follows the mouse cursor on the screen.

Target Sprites: There are two types of target sprites:

Icon Target: Regular target sprites that disappear when hit by the crosshair.

Icon Duck: Special duck targets that trigger a quacking sound effect when hit.

Sound Effects: Shooting the crosshair plays a gunshot sound effect, and hitting a duck target plays a quacking sound effect.

Fullscreen Display: The game runs in fullscreen mode, filling the entire screen with the game content.

# Controls

Mouse Movement: Move the mouse cursor to control the position of the crosshair.

Mouse Click (Left): Fire a shot from the crosshair.

Escape Key: Exit the game.
